For instance, if a venetian blinds supports tilting from horizontal to vertical by 90°, the minValue should be set to 0° and the maxValue to 90°. For venetian blinds that support tilting both direction, that is, a total of 180°, the minValue should be -90° and the maxValue should be 90°. 0° is always the horizontal position.",
